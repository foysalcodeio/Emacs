Auto-configure Emacs for C++ development involves a series of steps. Below is a simple example of a Bash script that you can use to download Emacs and set up a basic configuration for C++ development. This script assumes a Linux environment.
This script does the following:

1. Installs Emacs and build tools.<br />
2. Downloads a basic Emacs configuration for C++ development.<br />
3. Creates a minimal init.el configuration file.<br />

Just clone the repository:<br />
```
git clone https://github.com/foysalcodeio/Emacs.git
```

Save this script as, for example, install_emacs.sh. Make it executable by running:

```
cd Emacs
chmod +x install_emacs.sh
```
Run the script using:

```
./install_emacs.sh
```
Please note that this script assumes a Debian-based Linux distribution. If you're using a different distribution or operating system, you may need to modify the package installation commands accordingly. Additionally, you might want to customize the Emacs configuration further based on your specific needs.
